# Face-Detection-System-for-a-digital-camera

In this project we will build a face identification system from scratch, consisting of a scikit-learn pipeline that takes an input image and returns a list with bounding box coordinates. To do this, we will train our own model, with reduced computing power to allow training on a local machine.
